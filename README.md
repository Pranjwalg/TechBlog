# Techblog : Servlet,JSP & Mysql

In this project, I have created a blogging Web application using Servlet,JSP, and mySql With Authentication.
where the user is able to login or signup, after the successful login user can add the category-wise
post,and also user can see the posts that is posted by another user and the user can like and comment on
that post.
After registration if users want to edit their proﬁle details then user can easily edit it and the user is
capable of seeing the recent post in the home page.
